This is a tutorial environment, for learning Rust.

The repo contains the guessing game chapter of the 
[Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).
It also contains a `GEMINI.md` file, which contains the instructions for the AI assistant
to guide a beginner through the chapter.
